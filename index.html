                Wiki Story is a story generation game where players create a story collaboratively, making use of the ‘generate random article’ button on Wikipedia. 
                <br><br>
                Players take turns to add to the story, copying a portion of a sentence from a random article. The enjoyment of the game comes from trying to make meaning out of random content, finding creative ways to join things together. 
                <br><br>The story is finished when players feel like it has reached the end - this will usually be after a paragraph or two. Players can then read the story out loud to one another. 
                <br><br><br><br>

                <h1>Rules:</h1><br><br>
                <li>
2 players, turn-based </li>
<li>A new article is used for each turn</li>
<li>If the article contains very little text (e.g. only a sentence-long),  players are allowed to generate a new one</li>
<li>Players should copy and paste text from their article onto the shared doc/website</li>
<li>The length of the text is up to the player, but should be at least two words and not more than a full sentence long</li>
<li>Punctuation is ‘free’ - meaning that players can edit the last punctuation used in the story, and add their own at the end of their addition</li>
<li>The players decide amongst themselves when the story is finished</li>
                <li>They can then read the story out loud to one another </li>
