                Idea:<br><br>
                
                A game about generating short stories that makes use of the generate random article button on Wikipedia.<br><br>
                
                This could be played by any number of people, but I imagine over 8 would be a bit difficult to manage. Basically it would be turn-based. The first player would hit the button and start a story written on a piece of paper, copying a portion of a sentence on from the article onto the page. Each subsequent player would add to the story from new articles. The idea is to finish each other's sentences, or start a sentence if the last sentence had ended, while trying to build a narrative. <br><br>
                
                The game would end when the story feels ‘finished’. Probably a paragraph or two long. At the end of the game one player can read the story out loud.
